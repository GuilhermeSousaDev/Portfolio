          I am 18 years old and a programming student passionate about the world
          of technology. I live in Maca√∫bas-BA, Brazil, and have been studying
          programming for two years. I am always seeking new knowledge and
          challenges to develop professionally.
          <br /> <br />I am excited about the possibility of showcasing my
          projects and skills in my portfolio, and I hope that my enthusiasm and
          dedication for programming can be evident in every line of code I write.
          My goal is to contribute to the creation of technological solutions that
          can make a difference in people's and companies' lives.
