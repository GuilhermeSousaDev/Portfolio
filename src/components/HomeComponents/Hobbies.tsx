          I really enjoy exercising my brain in various ways, such as reading
          books, playing chess, or solving logic tests. Additionally, I also enjoy
          physical activities like playing soccer and going to the gym to keep my
          body healthy. Outside of my routine, I love traveling to discover new
          places. As for entertainment, my favorite TV show is Breaking Bad.
