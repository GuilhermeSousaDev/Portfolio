        I really enjoy exercising my brain in various ways, such as reading
        books, playing chess, or solving logic tests. Additionally, I also enjoy
        physical activities like playing soccer and going to the gym to keep my
        body healthy. Outside of my routine, I love traveling to discover new
        places. As for entertainment, my favorite TV show is Breaking Bad.
